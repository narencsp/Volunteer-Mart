### W3C Validation Test

* All the front-end code has been passed through the Validation service [5] and found to be complying the W3C standards.


### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - The frontend framework
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - The backend framework
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) - The backend framework for API calls

### Packages Used

* [CORS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) - The middleware to connect express
* [React-Bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap) - For responsive design
* [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) - To connect with the database
* [Body-Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) - The middleware to parse incoming requests

* [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - The library to request to API

### Integration 

* To integrate all the features developed by other team members we have a common index.js file and app.js file where the modules have been imported into our respective files of our backend code. 
* After integration the build files must be generated by running the build command which will be accessed by the deployment servers such as Heroku. 

### Deployment in a live stream

To deploy in live environment such as Heroku, the frontend and backend has to be deployed separately as different projects since the build files differ for both backend and frontend.
